DyPa
====

The Dynamic Parser Library
--------------------------

Most of existing parser libraries and tools either generate source code from a supplied grammar or require you to declare a class for your parser.
The aim of the DyPa project is to allow you construct a parser at runtime and use it without building.
DyPa curently uses PEG grammars for the best control over the parsing strategy.
